# dicebox
               Let's shake things up!

Overview
--------
An image classification and training system built with SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) in mind.  The project includes several client implementations, and future enhancements will continue to expand the API capabilities.

1. **Visual Image Classification**

    Dicebox is a visual classification system.  It can be reconfigured for different image sizes and categories.

2. **Evolutionary Neural Network**

    Dicebox is capable of being applied to a large variety of classification problems.  Sometimes unique or novel problems need to be solved and a neural network structure is unknown.  In this case dicebox provides a means to evolve a network tailored to the particular problem.

3. **Service-Oriented Architecture**
   
*   The trained neural network is accessed through a REST API.  
*   The Web Client (and supervised trainer) stores data to an AWS EFS via the REST API.
*   The Trainer uses the REST API for training data



High Level Components

* **Sensory Service**

    The sensory service is a REST API that will store data that needs to be added to training set for a given classification.  It is primary consumed by the stand-alone trainer.

    Provides input data directly for small batch sizes, or can queue up large batch orders for creation by the batch processor.
 


Sensory Service
===============
Provides an end-point that performs input data storage and retrieval via REST API calls.
* Stores data with classifications that are sent to it from the client/supervisored trainer.
* Provides data sets for the stand-alone trainer while building the weights.
    * For small batches of the data a single API call can be used.  
    * For large batches a batch order is created and the trainer polls the sensory service to get all the training data. (The sensory service pulls the data off a RabbitMQ queue with a matching batch order id.)


**Start the service (development only):**
```
    python ./sensory_service.py
```

I've tested running the sensory service with uwsgi, and proxied through nginx.  Nginx configurations can be found within ./nginx of this repository.
```
uwsgi --http-socket 127.0.0.1:5000 --manage-script-name --mount /=sensory_service.py --plugin python,http --enable-threads --callable app â€”master
```

### Production Deployment

**Docker Container**

The recommended way to run the service is by using the official provided docker container.
The container should be deployed to a Docker Swarm as a service.

**Example**
```
docker service create \
--detach=false \
--publish 8002:80 \
--replicas 1 \
--log-driver json-file \
--mount type=volume,volume-driver=cloudstor:aws,source=dicebox,destination=/dicebox \
--name sensoryservice shapeandshare/dicebox.sensoryservice
```

How to apply rolling updates of the service within the swarm:
```
docker service update --image shapeandshare/dicebox.sensoryservice:latest sensoryservice
```

In the examples above the Docker Swarm was deployed to AWS and had the Cloudstor:aws plugin enabled and active.
The sensory service containers will store and read data from the shared storage.

**Global shared Cloudstor volumes mounted by all tasks in a swarm service.**

The below command is an example of how to create the shared volume within the docker swarm:
```
docker volume create -d "cloudstor:aws" --opt backing=shared dicebox
```
