Sensory Service
===============
Provides an end-point that performs input data storage and retrieval via REST API calls.
* Stores data with classifications that are sent to it from the client/supervisored trainer.
* Provides data sets for the stand-alone trainer while building the weights.
    * For small batches of the data a single API call can be used.  
    * For large batches a batch order is created and the trainer polls the sensory service to get all the training data. (The sensory service pulls the data off a RabbitMQ queue with a matching batch order id.)


### Getting Started
The application is meant to be run within a docker container.  If you need to run it outside of the container for development you will need to make the core libraries and dicebox.config file available to the application.

**Development Runtime Layout**
```
/root
    /app
        /lib 
        /dicebox.config
        [...]
    /assets
    /dicebox
    [...]
```
* Symbolicly link /root/dicebox -> /root/app/lib
* Copy dicebox.config into /root/app

**Start the service (development only):**
```
    python ./sensory_service.py
```

I've tested running the sensory service with uwsgi, and proxied through nginx.  Nginx configurations can be found within ./nginx of this repository.
```
uwsgi --http-socket 127.0.0.1:5000 --manage-script-name --mount /=sensory_service.py --plugin python,http --enable-threads --callable app â€”master
```

### RabbitMQ Configuration
* Service account for the service to connect to the vhost
* vhost: sensory
* exchange: sensory.exchange
  * type: topic
* queue: sensory.batch.request.task.queue
* binding:
  * (exchange) sensory.exchange >--> (routing key): task_queue >--> (queue) sensory.batch.request.task.queue


### Production Deployment

**Docker Container**

The recommended way to run the service is by using the official provided docker container. The container is published to Docker Hub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/shapeandshare/dicebox.sensoryservice/).

The container should be deployed to a Docker Swarm as a service, or as a stand-alone container within a Docker Engine.

**Example**
```
docker service create \
--detach=false \
--publish 8002:80 \
--replicas 1 \
--log-driver json-file \
--mount type=volume,volume-driver=cloudstor:aws,source=dicebox,destination=/dicebox \
--name sensoryservice shapeandshare/dicebox.sensoryservice
```

How to apply rolling updates of the service within the swarm:
```
docker service update --image shapeandshare/dicebox.sensoryservice:latest sensoryservice
```

In the examples above the Docker Swarm was deployed to AWS and had the Cloudstor:aws plugin enabled and active.
The sensory service containers will store and read data from the shared storage.

**Global shared Cloudstor volumes mounted by all tasks in a swarm service.**

The below command is an example of how to create the shared volume within the docker swarm:
```
docker volume create -d "cloudstor:aws" --opt backing=shared dicebox
```
